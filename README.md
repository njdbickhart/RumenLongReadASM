Scripts, notes and commands to accompany our Rumen Metagenome assembly manuscript

All files are provided as-is in the hopes that they would be useful for ongoing work. Many of the utilities in this repository were used to identify links between rumen microbes and genetic features; however, they should be equally useful for the analysis of other prokaryotic metagenomics communities.

## Viral (or mobile DNA) link analysis

Please see the scripts and README in the "viralAnalysisScripts" subfolder for more details and a quickStart guide.

## Utility scripts

These are very useful, multi-purpose scripts designed to help interrogate the data. They were used frequently in this analysis and automate some quick command line analysis of tabular datasets.
